# WebAssembly Runtimes 
WebAssembly, or wasm for short, is a low-level bytecode format that runs in the browser just like JavaScript.
It is designed to be faster to parse than JavaScript, as well as faster to execute. 

Webassembly is not strictly meant for the web, it is also designed to be used non-web environment as well. 
This file contains a list of non-web wasm runtimes in development in no particular order. :octocat:
